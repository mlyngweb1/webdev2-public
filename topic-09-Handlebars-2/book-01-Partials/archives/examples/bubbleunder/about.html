    <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p><span class = "fun">Bubble Under</span> is a group of diving enthusiasts based in the
          south-west UK who meet up for diving trips in the summer
          months when the weather is good and the bacon rolls are
          flowing. We arrange weekends away as small groups to cut
          the costs of accommodation and travel and to ensure that
          everyone gets a trustworthy dive buddy.</p>
      <p>Although we're based in the south-west, we don't stay on
          our own turf: past diving weekends away have included
          trips up to Scapa Flow in Scotland and to Malta's numerous
          wreck sites.</p>
      <p>When we're not diving, we often meet up in a local pub to
      talk about our recent adventures (any excuse, eh?).</p>
      <p>Or as our man Bob Dobalina would put it:</p>
      <blockquote class = "fun"><q>Happiness is a dip in the ocean followed by a pint or two of Old Speckled Hen.
       You can quote me on that!</q></blockquote>
